        <h1>The Rich History of Paper Money in Iceland</h1>
        <p>Banknotes have been issued in Iceland since 1778, but in that year
            Danish Courant banknotes with Icelandic text on the reverse were
            legalized. In the nearly 250 years that have passed since then, a total
            of 71 different banknote editions have seen the light of day in Iceland,
            issued by eight different banks or official bodies.</p>
        <p>The first bank to be established in Denmark was the Kurantbanken (The
            Courant Bank) in Copenhagen, a privately owned bank that began operating
            in 1736 and issued its first banknotes a year later. The bank was
            nationalized in 1773 and forty years later it closed its doors for
            good.</p>
        <p>Five years after the state acquired it, in 1778, by a royal decree of
            April 22nd, 1778, Danish Courant Banknotes of the denomination 1 and 5
            'rigsdaler' were legalized for use in Iceland with the prerequisite that
            an Icelandic text was printed on the previously blank reverse. The
            Icelandic text stated the notes validity in Denmark, Norway, and its
            duchies at the time (Schleswig and Holstein), as well as in Iceland (the
            country had been ‚Äì for better or worse ‚Äì</p>
        <p>under the control of the Crown of Denmark since 1380). The Icelandic
            text was undated with the earliest recorded host note dated 1777.</p>
        <p>The Courant banknotes are not thought to have been much used in
            Iceland though, since trade was still restricted by a Danish monopoly of
            ill repute when they appeared. In all likelihood, Icelanders in those
            times would have preferred, by habit, to trust in barter arrangements or
            in weighed precious metals. And it turned out they were right; the
            Courant Banknotes did not prove trustworthy in the long run.</p>
        <p>Upon the collapse of the Danish currency in 1813 the Courant Bank
            became insolvent and the Courant notes practically worthless. A new
            state bank, the Rigsbank, was founded and given the sole right to issue
            notes. By a royal decree, the Rigsbank notes were validated in Iceland
            from March 20th, 1815. One riksbankedaler in 1815 had Icelandic
            inscription on the back of a Danish note from 1814. After the Danish
            Rigsbank notes with Icelandic validations were recalled from circulation
            in 1820, and up until the time that the National Treasury of Iceland
            (Landssj√≥√∞ur) issued its first banknotes in 1886, there was no currency
            specifically identified for use in Iceland, and mostly Danish banknotes
            were used instead with minted coins.</p>
        <h3>The National Bank of Iceland (Landsbanki √çslands)</h3>
        <p>Under a law passed in 1885, the newly founded National Treasury of
            Iceland (Landssj√≥√∞ur) was permitted to issue notes in its own name,
            which subsequently became the initial capital of Landsbanki √çslands (the
            National Bank of Iceland). The first Icelandic paper money was issued in
            1886.</p>
        <p>In the fourth article of the Banking Act, it said, among other
            things, that "nobody other than the National Treasury of Iceland is
            allowed to issue banknotes in this country. The notes can be exchanged
            for other notes in the National Bank of Iceland, but also for coins,
            depending on what is available at the time."</p>
        <p>The notes were designed and printed in Denmark. They had a picture of
            Christian IX, King of Denmark, on the front, but the reverse of the 5
            krona and 10 krona banknotes was blank. The reverse of the 50 krona note
            has a picture of The Lady of the Mountain, a female incarnation/national
            personification of Iceland. Only one copy of the 50 krona note is
                known to be privately owned in Iceland.</p>
        <p>The look and design of the banknotes was according to a royal
                decree issued on May 20, 1886, which read as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"The letters I. L. are watermarked in the paper on which the notes
                are printed. On both smaller sides of each banknote, the paper strip is
                uncut and the edge is therefore uneven. On the front of each note on the
                left is a bust of His Majesty the King; there, the Icelandic value of
                the banknotes is printed in black letters, and the number is replaced by
                letters. Underneath, in black letters, are the words: 'Issued according
                to law Sept. 18. 1885. For the National Treasury of Iceland,' and here
                the Governor of Iceland signs his name. One of the bank officials also
                writes his name on each note. The number showing the value of each note
                is printed on the top and in the right-hand corner. The color of these
                numbers and various ornaments found on the banknote, as well as the base
                color of the banknotes, is brown on the 50 krona banknotes, blue on the
                10 krona banknotes, and gray on the 5 krona banknotes. There is nothing
                printed on the back of the 10 and 5 kroner notes; but on the back of the
                50 kr√≥na notes, there is a woman's portrait and the number 50 printed on
                both sides inside an ornament. Finally, each banknote has its serial
                number printed in two places."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>By the middle of July 1886, Landsbanki √çslands had lent about 40
            thousand krona, but there were loan applications for five times that
            amount. At that time, only the 10 krona notes had been used, but thirty
            thousand copies had arrived by mail ship to the country, i.e., 300
            thousand ISK of the 500 thousand that the bank was allowed to have in
            its possession. The reason for that was said to be that the Governor of
            Iceland and the bank managers, who had to sign the bills, had not had
            time to do so due to other obligations, i.a. national administration and
            parliamentary duties. It was said that at full capacity, they could only
            sign one thousand notes a day. According to rumours at the time, the
            Governor himself wrote particularly slowly. This bottleneck continued to
            exist, and even a year after the bank began operations, it was said that
            people had difficulty getting a loan in the last few weeks because there
            were not enough signed notes available.</p>
        <p>The banknotes of Landsbanki √çslands were recalled in 1909. The second
            issue of notes from The National Treasury of Iceland (Landssj√≥√∞ur) was
            put into circulation on 25 July 1907 and was special in that the 5 krona
            note and the 10 krona note had a picture of King Christian IX on the
            front, while the 50 krona note, however, had a picture of King Frederick
            VIII on the front. It is interesting, and perhaps amusing, that all
            Icelandic banknotes up to 1931 had a picture of Danish kings on the
            front, but pictures of Danish kings have never been used on Danish
            banknotes. Only two unpunched copies of the 50 krona note from 1907 are
            known among collectors, and it is probably the rarest Icelandic note in
            history overall. However, the rarest Icelandic banknote is undoubtedly
            the 10 krona note from the third issue of the National Treasury of
            Iceland, with six small numbers (serial number) and a handwritten
            signature. Only one copy of this note is known to be in private
            ownership.</p>
        <h3>The Bank of Iceland (√çslandsbanki)</h3>
        <p>In 1904 a private bank, √çslandsbanki (Bank of Iceland) was founded,
            with mainly foreign investment capital. The first description of the
            future banknote issue can be found in March 1904, when it was reported
            in the Danish newspaper Dannebrog that the King had approved proposals
            of the contraversial Iceland's minister, Peter Alberti, regarding the
            design of the banknotes, shortly before the minister retired:</p>
        <p>"After an extremely fierce competition, the preparation of the
            banknotes was entrusted to L. Levison junr. in Copenhagen, an agent of a
            well-known company, Giesecke &amp; Devrient in Leipzig. The main
            deciding factor was that Giesecke &amp; Devrient provided the most solid
            guarantee available to ensure that it would be impossible to forge the
            notes. They say they have printed hundreds of billions' worth of
            banknotes for various countries, both here on the continent and
            elsewhere, and no banknote from them has ever been forged; a result that
            hardly any other company in the world has achieved. It will, therefore,
            be highly unlikely that the banknotes can be counterfeited. All
            imaginable precautions are taken. Among other things, the notes are made
            in such a way that they cannot be photographed, and the extremely
            expensive guilloche machines used to print them are made specially for
            Giesecke &amp; Devrient. This is all very unfortunate for
            counterfeiters. But it's good for everyone else that there will never be
            anything but unfalsified Icelandic banknotes."</p>
        <p>The initial issue of √çslandsbanki banknotes in 1904 consisted of
            denominations of 5 krona, 10 krona, 50 krona, and 100 krona. All
            banknotes featured a portrait of the King, and the higher-value notes
            also depicted the mountain Hekla, thought in the Middle ages to be a
            gateway to Hell, and the famous hot spring Geysir. The notes with
                lower value were considered too small for such decorations on
                front. The reverse side of the banknotes featured an image of a
            majestic gyrfalcon, Iceland's national bird. ‚ÄúThey will also all
                be adorned with richly designed, interlaced spirals. They are called
                guilloche in french. The watermark l. B. (i.e. √çslands banki) will be
                embedded in the paper, with dark letters and white white." An Icelandic
                newspaper expressed satisfaction with the design, but added that
                "hopefully these notes will be nicer and cleaner in design than the new
                stamps."</p>
        <p>The √çslandsbanki commenced operations in June 1904 and was granted a
            30-year authority to issue gold-backed banknotes. The gold standard was
            originally for ¬º of all notes in circulation but that was changed later
            on to ¬æ of notes in circulation. This arrangement effectively made
            √çslandsbanki the de facto central bank of Iceland until 1927 when
            Landsbanki √çslands assumed that role.</p>
        <p>On the day √çslandsbanki opened, June 7, 1904, it issued four
                kinds of paper money, 5 krona, 10 krona, 50 krona and 100 krona.
            The initial banknote issue amounted to ten million Icelandic krona at
            that time, but the bank was allowed to have only a quarter of that
            amount in circulation. The cost of designing and printing the banknotes
            at Giesecke &amp; Devrient was 50 thousand ISK at the time, which was
            considered expensive. To manage the cost, the bank opted to create a
            large reserve upfront and then recall worn-out banknotes and replace
            them as needed. It is worth noting that the company Giesecke &amp;
                Devrient is still in operation and prints paper money for various
                nations.</p>
        <p>The new √çslandsbanki banknotes were extremely elaborate in their
            design by the standards of the time and immediately highly regarded by
            Icelanders. Many people eagerly exchanged their Landsbanki notes for
            √çslandsbanki notes, appreciating the look and quality of the new paper
            money.</p>
        <p>Only ten days after the bank began operations, the Reykjav√≠k
            newspaper Bjarki wrote that "the bank notes of the joint-stock bank are
            now circulating around town and they are very carefully made, beautiful
            and the paper is strong." And as the months went by and people gained
            more experience with the notes, their satisfaction remained
            undiminished. A columnist wrote the following autumn, 'Not only are the
            √çslandsbanki notes equally guaranteed as the Danish notes, but their
            quality is superior and they are significantly more challenging to
            imitate or counterfeit.'" The √çslandsbanki notes were valid in
                Iceland until 1940.</p>
        <p>In 1919, due to a shortage of √çslandsbanki banknotes, the bank's
            management, with the permission of the Icelandic Government, decided to
            overprint 5 krona notes from the first edition of the National Treasury
            of Iceland (Landssj√≥√∞ur) with a 100 krona value. This was convenient in
            many ways, since the reverse of the 5 krona note was blank, and all the
            text on its front was overprinted. A total of 15,000 such notes were
            issued and remained valid until they were recalled along with other
            √çslandsbanki notes in 1940. √çslandsbanki also issued new 5 krona and 10
            krona banknotes in 1920, which were designed and printed in Germany as
            before.</p>
        <p>√çslandsbanki encountered financial difficulties and ultimately went
            bankrupt in 1930, mainly due to the consequences of the Wall Street
            Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Following the bankruptcy,
            Landsbanki √çslands assumed responsibility for all of √çslandsbanki's
            banknotes. The √çslandsbanki notes, including the 5 krona and 10 krona
            denominations issued in 1920, remained valid until 1940. At that point,
            the banknotes were recalled and replaced.</p>
        <h3>New banks, new era</h3>
        <p>Due to the lack of coins in Iceland in 1920, it was decided to issue
            1 krona notes. This practice continued until 1925, but in 1922, two
            small coins were minted: 10 eyrir and 25 eyrir (eyrir is an Icelandic
            monetary unit worth one hundredth of a krona). Other denominations were
            minted until 1926, including a 1 krona coin and a 2 krona coin in
            1925.</p>
        <p>Following the Sovereignty Act of 1918, the National Treasury of
            Iceland (Landssj√≥√∞ur) was renamed without any change in its role. In
            1925, it issued 5 krona, 10 krona, and 50 krona notes, which entered
            circulation the same year. Their design was very similar to the third
            issue of the Landssj√≥√∞ur, as well as the paper money issued by
            Landsbanki √çslands between 1929 and 1931. The bank also issued a 100
            krona note in 1929, in accordance with laws from 1927. This marked the
            end of the issuance of Icelandic paper money designed and printed in
            Denmark and Iceland. After that, banknotes were designed and printed in
            Iceland and the UK, and Icelandic paper money continued to be printed in
            the UK until the turn of the century in 2000.</p>
        <p>In 1957, Landsbanki √çslands was divided into two independent
            sections: the commercial bank with the same name as before, and a
            central bank named Se√∞labanki √çslands. In 1961, the Central Bank of
            Iceland (Se√∞labanki √çslands) was founded as a separate institution with
            the rights and obligations of issuing banknotes. The former bank issued
            paper money that was put into circulation in 1960, including 5 krona, 10
            krona, 25 krona, 100 krona, and 1000 krona notes, but the first issue of
            Se√∞labanki √çslands went into circulation from 1963 to 1971. In 1981, the
            Icelandic krona was revalued, due to high inflation, with 100 old krona
            being worth 1 new krona, and a new 500 krona banknote was first put into
            circulation in 1981. The 1000 krona was put into circulation in 1984 and
            the 5000 krona in 1986. The 2000 krona banknote was put into circulation
            in 1995 but never became very popular. The 10,000 krona banknote was put
            into circulation in 2013 and it is generally believed that it will be
            the last banknote which the Central Bank of Iceland will issue. Laws and
            regulations regarding the bank have undergone several changes since its
            establishment, most recently in 2023.</p>
        <p>It is safe to say that the printing of paper money has been
            revolutionized since the issuance of the first Icelandic paper money at
            the end of the 18th century. The future of banknotes in Iceland, as in
            the world in general, is uncertain. However, it is beyond doubt that the
            nearly 250-year history of Icelandic paper money is extremely
            interesting, and their design throughout that period reflects both
            immeasurable beauty and rigorous contemplation from those involved in
            their creation. It is a rich history indeed.</p>
