        <h1>A Wide and Welcoming Forum for Collectors</h1>

        <p>
            In the 1960s, interest in collecting coins and banknotes in Iceland
            increased significantly. At that time, numerous collectors, whose exact
            numbers are unknown, had been independently pursuing their hobby for years
            or even decades, with little or no contact with each other. This surge in
            interest can partly be attributed to new currency issues from ‚ÄúLandsbanki
            √çslands-Se√∞labankinn‚Äù in 1960 and subsequent issues from the Central Bank of
            Iceland. Media coverage on various aspects of coin and banknote collecting
            became more frequent, exemplified by a prominent interview in the newspaper
            V√≠sir in the summer of 1961 with policeman √ìlafur Gu√∞mundsson, dubbed the
            most prolific coin collector in Iceland.
        </p>

        <h2>Interest Grows and Coverage Increases</h2>

        <p> As public and media interest grew, so did the number of collectors. Shops
            that had previously catered only to stamp collectors began selling albums
            for storing coins and banknotes, price lists, and books about collecting.
            Individuals, including one Sigur√∞ur √û. √ûorl√°ksson, started advertising in
            newspapers for Icelandic coins, banknotes, bread tokens, and various other
            private currencies used in Iceland over the years. The participation of
            Helgi J√≥nsson, a master cabinetmaker, in a coin exhibition in East Germany
            in 1968 also drew public attention. He was reportedly the first Icelander to
            participate in such an exhibition and received a bronze medal for his
            collection.</p>
        <h2>Collectors Discuss Forming an Association</h2>

        <p>
            As the decade progressed, a close-knit group of enthusiasts, who regularly
            met in Reykjav√≠k's cafes, began discussing the need for an association to
            connect Icelandic collectors. Among them were √ûorl√°ksson, Sn√¶r J√≥hannesson,
            a bookbinder and later an antique book dealer, and his cousin, Indri√∞i
            Indri√∞ason, a writer and genealogist.</p>

        <p> On August 15, 1968, a news article appeared in both the newspapers
            √ûj√≥√∞viljinn and Al√æ√Ω√∞ubla√∞i√∞ announcing the decision to establish an
            association for Icelandic coin collectors, provided there was enough
            interest. The initiative aimed to "address the challenges faced by those
            who collect old coins and banknotes." Similar articles appeared in other
            major Icelandic newspapers later that month. √ûorl√°ksson, the driving force
            behind the initiative, invited interested individuals to send their names
            and addresses to his home or call a provided telephone number.</p>

        <p> In early autumn, several enthusiasts held two meetings at Caf√© H√∂ll in
            Austurstr√¶ti to discuss the establishment of an association for coin and
            banknote collectors and to draft its bylaws.</p>

        <h2>Founding Meeting: Thirty Invited</h2>

        <p> Continuing these preparations, a founding meeting was held on January 19,
            1969. The meeting minutes note that "several enthusiasts of coin collecting
            and numismatics convened at the Nordic House in Reykjav√≠k. Thirty people
            were invited, and all but one attended, with the absentee submitting a
            request for admission to the prospective association."</p>

        <p> After appointing a chairman and secretary, √ûorl√°ksson explained that the
            meeting was not advertised publicly to avoid delays caused by attendees
            unfamiliar with numismatics. However, he emphasized that anyone could become
            a founding member before March 1st, 1969. √ûorl√°ksson added that the
            association could benefit its members by saving them money on ordering items
            from abroad and by documenting the history of Icelandic numismatics, which
            would otherwise be impossible without collaborative efforts. Various names
            for the association were suggested, but Indri√∞i Indri√∞ason‚Äôs suggestion,
            "Myntsafnaraf√©lag √çslands" (The Icelandic Numismatic Association), was
            unanimously accepted.</p>


        <h2>Promoting and Encouraging Coin Collecting</h2>

        <p> At the official founding meeting at the Nordic House on January 19, 1969,
            √ûorl√°ksson outlined the initiative's background and the association's
            potential projects. The founders had ambitious, long-term goals: "The
            purpose of the association is to support and promote coin collecting in the
            international sense of the word numismatics. This includes coins, paper
            money, medals, and private currencies (tokens). To promote and encourage
            interest in coin collecting generally, to establish mutual acquaintances and
            business among members, and to strengthen these connections. The association
            aims to achieve its goals through distributing information, publishing
            activities, exhibitions, lectures, briefings, business meetings, and
            auctions. Additionally, the association aims to facilitate joint purchases
            of collectible items and engage in social initiatives." One of its first
            projects should be collecting data on Iceland's coin history and publishing
            a comprehensive handbook. The coin history of Iceland was in disarray, he
            said, and data had to be gathered from various continents to complete such a
            work.</p>

        <p> √ûorl√°ksson was elected to the first board of The Icelandic Numismatic
            Association, alongside Sigurj√≥n Sigur√∞sson, a merchant, and √ìlafur
            Gu√∞mundsson, a policeman. The deputies were Helgi J√≥nsson, a master
            cabinetmaker, and Sn√¶r J√≥hannesson, a bookbinder. Vilhj√°lmur Vilhj√°lmsson, a
            shopkeeper, and Indri√∞i Indri√∞ason, a genealogist, were elected accountants.</p>


        <h2>A Dynamic Group of Entrepeneurs</h2>

        <p> Various news articles about the new association appeared in the following
            weeks, including a prominent story on the back page of the daily newspaper
            Morgunbla√∞i√∞, which likely sparked significant interest. In March, an
            "introduction and exchange meeting" was held at Caf√© H√∂ll, followed by
            another "exchange meeting" two weeks later, both welcoming new members.
        </p>

        <p> At the first official board meeting of The Icelandic Numismatic Association
            (INA) on June 11, 1969, Gu√∞mundsson resigned, and J√≥nsson took his place.
            The board then divided its tasks, with J√≥nsson becoming the first chairman,
            √ûorl√°ksson the secretary, and Sigur√∞sson the treasurer. Notably, the board
            also had for years a special position called "foreign correspondent",
            responsible for answering letters and inquiries from global coin collectors
            and managing relations with foreign associations and coin traders. Reviewing
            the association's chairmen since its inception, Anton Holt, a numismatic
            expert, served as chairman four times for a total of seventeen years. Freyr
            J√≥hannesson, a civil engineer, served three times for a total of twelve
            years, while the current chairman, Eir√≠kur J. L√≠ndal, a psychologist, has
            held the position consecutively since 2014.</p>


        <h2>In the Garden of Heavenly Peace</h2>

        <p> In the fall of 1969, INA moved its meetings to the restaurant H√°b√¶r, which
            advertised its "Garden of Heavenly Peace" with Chinese-themed decorations.
        </p>
        <p> The association quickly became active, organizing exchange meetings for
            collectors, purchasing coins from abroad, and both foreign and Icelandic
            commemorative coins. INA also published a price list for Icelandic coins and
            established a coin collection owned by the association to this day. In
            January 1970, INA participated in the "We are the Young People" exhibition
            at T√≥nab√¶r, showcasing their activities alongside The Icelandic Stamp
            Collectors Federation and Reykjav√≠k Chess Club. INA members displayed coins
            from various eras, both domestic and foreign. By the association's
            anniversary meeting in 1970, membership had grown to 150.
        </p>

        <p> INA's first auction meeting, intended only for members, was held in late
            1970. That arrangement ‚Äì auctions for members only ‚Äì continues today. That
            same year, INA joined the American Numismatic Association (ANA). Membership
            exceeded 170 by the 1971 general meeting.</p>


        <h2>The First Icelandic Coin Exhibition</h2>

        <p> In April 1972, INA, in collaboration with the National Museum of Iceland,
            held an exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of the first coins minted
            specifically for Iceland. This was the first coin exhibition ever held in
            Iceland, featuring Icelandic and foreign coins, banknotes, business tokens,
            private currencies, honorary and commemorative coins, and other rare items.
            A newspaper covering the exhibition noted the display of "various very rare
            items, sheldom or never seen by the general public." An exhibition catalog
            included articles by notable figures such as President Kristj√°n Eldj√°rn,
            Central Bank manager J√≥hannes Nordal, and National Museum director √û√≥r
            Magn"sson. The exhibition was well-attended and received, prompting strong
            encouragement for the National Museum to establish a dedicated department
            for Icelandic coins and banknotes.</p>


        <h2>Vigor and ambition</h2>

        <p> INA's activities soon settled into a regular pattern: monthly meetings for
            exchanging notes and coins, discussing new issues, and holding auctions. The
            board also managed the purchase of coins from foreign mints and dealers for
            its members.</p>
        <p> In the fall of 1973, the association brought Danish numismatist Johan Chr.
            Holm to Iceland for two lectures at the Nordic House. Later that year, Dr.
            √ìlafur Tryggvason, an INA member, delivered a lecture on the classification
            and cleaning of coins, further enriching the association's educational
            efforts.
        </p>

        <p> When INA celebrated its 5th anniversary in 1974, about 250 members had
            joined, most of them living in the Reykjav√≠k area, with a few dozen from the
            countryside and some living abroad. The association held auction meetings
            once a month, usually on Saturdays in the basement of the Templarah√∂ll, a
            hall belonging to the I.O.O.F. in Iceland. Ragnar Borg, a businessman and an
            INA member from the beginning, was usually the auctioneer, with Indri√∞ason
            and Holt stepping in if needed.</p>
        <p> In early spring 1975, the INA board decided to hold a competition for a new
            logo, open to everyone. It was emphasized that the logo should maintain its
            clarity when resized. </p>

        <p> The winner was √Årni Helgason, who designed a font logo featuring the
            association's initials, M√ç, in black and white.</p>


        <h2>Coin Education for the Public</h2>

        <p> Ragnar Borg was hired to write a special column about coin and banknote
            collecting in the daily Morgunbla√∞i√∞, where he contributed regularly for
            nearly two decades. These columns were widely read and attracted many to the
            field, significantly boosting INA's recruitment. Borg often wrote about the
            association's "internal" activities, providing it with unparalleled access
            to the Icelandic public.</p>
        <p> At this time, the INA board also decided to establish an "exchange club":
            "The idea is that people can meet once a month to exchange or sell items,
            access price lists and books from the association's library." The first
            club meeting was held in April 1975 on the second floor of a new downtown
            Reykjav√≠k location, accommodating twenty to thirty people. "We can find a
            bigger location later if needed," Ragnar Borg stated in an article in
            Morgunbla√∞i√∞, noting that around 90 people attended the last INA meeting.
        </p>


        <h2>Appealing to the Countryside and Starting a Newsletter</h2>

        <p> In mid-June 1975, INA, in collaboration with The Icelandic Stamp Collectors
            Federation, held a three-day exhibition of banknotes, coins, and stamps at
            Hagask√≥li, which was well attended. Soon after, they held another exhibition
            in Akureyri to introduce residents outside the capital area to the joys and
            benefits of coin collecting, resulting in numerous new members from the
            North.</p>
        <p> In 1976, INA decided to start publishing the newsletter Mynt, which would
            include "various information about coins and collecting, such as talks
            given on behalf of the association, instructions on handling and classifying
            coins, and other relevant content." The newsletter also contained an
            auction catalog for INA's monthly auctions and has been continuously
            published since. Over the years, Tryggvi √ìlafsson and Baldvin Halld√≥rsson
            have served the longest as editors.</p>


        <h2>Auctions in the Palace of the Templars, Meetings in the House of Doctors</h2>

        <p> By the fall of 1976, INA had about 330 members. The chairman at that time,
            Ragnar Borg, wrote about the association's activities, noting: "In recent
            years, the board has ensured that talks on numismatic topics are given at
            meetings, featuring both domestic and foreign experts and academics. This
            will continue this winter with color slides purchased from the well-known
            English coin company Seaby, accompanied by explanations of known coins from
            ancient times."</p>
        <p> INA held two social meetings per month. One Saturday a month, members
            gathered in the basement of the Templarah√∂llin on Eir√≠ksgata to sell or
            exchange coins, banknotes, commemorative coins, and other collectibles,
            ending with an auction. On one Thursday each month, informal club meetings
            were held at Domus Medica, where members discussed collections over coffee
            and shared their items. These meetings later moved to three rooms at
            Amtmannsst√≠g 2. At the 1977 general meeting, INA had 350 members.
        </p>


        <h2>Silver Melted into Commemorative Medals</h2>

        <p> In 1979, the association bought 390 silver coins minted by the Icelandic
            Olympic Committee in 1972 and 13 Olympic Committee coins from 1976, totaling
            about eleven kilos, which were melted down to mint the 10th-anniversary
            commemorative medals for INA. The company √çs-Spor minted 150 medals based on
            a design by sculptor Sveinn √ìlafsson.</p>
        <p> INA also held a ten-year anniversary exhibition at the National Museum of
            Iceland, which was well received despite extremely bad weather during the
            exhibition days that affected the attendance. Because of the subsequent loss
            of money, 18 years passed before the Icelandic Numismatic Association
            decided to hold another special exhibition on its own.</p>


        <h2>A "Charming Lady" Among the First Honorary Members</h2>

        <p> P√©tur Hoffmann Sal√≥monsson was elected INA's first honorary member in early
            1977, remaining the club's sole honorary member for several years.
            Sal√≥monsson, a longtime coin seller, had coins minted with his own image in
            copper, silver, and gold from 1962 to 1968; these so-called Selsvarardalur
            coins became sought-after collectibles. In 1982, INA elected two more
            honorary members: Helgi J√≥nsson, the first chairman and registered member
            number one, and Mrs. Ella Einarsson. When explaining Mrs. Einarsson's
            selection, the board noted, "One of the members who has contributed to
            making the meetings more enjoyable is Mrs. Ella Einarsson. She has set an
            example for others in terms of attendance, is lively and entertaining in
            discussions, and genuinely participates in auctions. Every club or
            association is blessed to have such a charming lady as Mrs. Ella Einarsson
            in its ranks."</p>

        <p> The following year, INA elected its first foreign honorary member, Danish
            coin dealer and numismatic expert Johann Chr. Holm. Other notable foreign
            visitors included Danish numismatist Jerry Mayer, who lectured for INA in
            1986 and returned twice in subsequent years to provide educational talks to
            members.</p>


        <h2>INA Joins the Nordic Numismatic Union</h2>

        <p> In the fall of 1982, INA participated in a coin exhibition and market in
            Akureyri in collaboration with the Association of Stamp Collectors in
            Akureyri, an event considered a great success. In 1984, INA was invited for
            the first time to take part in the NORDIA exhibition, held at the
            Laugardalsh√∂ll sports palace. The first collector's market organized by INA
            and open to the public occurred in 1986, in collaboration with several other
            collector organizations. This lively event demonstrated significant public
            interest in collecting, even among those not affiliated with any organizing
            associations.</p>

        <p> INA became a member of the Nordic Numismatic Union in 1983 and hosted the
            union's all- Nordic conference in Reykjav√≠k in the summer of 1989. To
            commemorate the association's 20th anniversary and the conference, INA
            minted a bronze commemorative coin. The association also introduced a new
            logo, designed by √û√≥runn √Årnad√≥ttir with font design by Sveinn √ìlafsson. The
            logo features the association's name in blue letters forming a laurel around
            a heather green, slightly stylized drawing of the "money flower"
            (Rhinanthus minor), named for its money-shaped fruit.</p>


        <h2>New Headquarters</h2>

        <p> In 1990, INA moved from Amtmannst√≠gur to the premises of the Icelandic Stamp
            Collectors Federation at S√≠√∞um"la 17, which has since been INA's main
            headquarters for meetings, auctions, and collectors' markets. From the
            mid-1990s, the association also organized educational meetings on various
            collecting topics, frequently led by Anton Holt, Freyr J√≥hannesson, and
            J"l√≠us Arn√≥rsson, among others.</p>

        <h2>Exhibitions Reflecting Diversity</h2>

        <p> After an 18-year hiatus, INA held an ambitious exhibition at the Hafnarborg
            art museum in 1997, showcasing 220 years of Icelandic currency and various
            other collectibles. This marked a shift in the association's focus,
            emphasizing the diversity of its members' collections beyond just coins and
            banknotes. This inclusive approach reflected the wide range of interests
            among INA members, many of whom collected various curiosities in addition to
            or instead of currency.</p>

        <p> This evolution was even more evident at INA's next exhibition, held 15 years
            later in the Nordic House in the spring of 2012. The exhibition featured the
            collectibles of eleven members, including rare documents and items from
            Iceland's history, such as artifacts from the oldest version of
            √çslandsbanki, memorabilia from King Frederick III of Denmark's 1907 visit to
            Iceland, items from the 1930 Parliamentary Festival and the 1944 Republican
            celebration, along with Icelandic matchsticks and cigarette cases. The
            emphasis on diversity made the exhibition extremely successful.

        <h2>The World of Collecting Still Fascinates</h2>

        <p> When the Icelandic Numismatic Association celebrated its 50th anniversary in
            2019, it marked the occasion with an ambitious and auspicious exhibition.
            Guests marveled at countless rare and priceless objects from a variety of
            sources. Held in the hall of the Iceland Touring Association, the exhibition
            garnered significant attention and was very well attended. The INA proved
            that despite today's fierce competition for the public's attention, the
            world of collecting could still fascinate young and old alike.</p>

        <p> In the years since this major milestone, INA has remained steadfast in its
            mission, following the spirit and path set by its founders. Monthly auction
            meetings for members, held ten months a year, are the cornerstone of its
            activities. This is complemented by the publication of the "Mynt"
            newsletter, and two collectors' markets each year, which are open to the
            public and have consistently enjoyed popularity.</p>


        <h2>A Collector's Haven Since the Beginning</h2>
        <p> The INA has long established itself as one of the primary forums for
            dedicated collectors in Iceland. The association serves as a haven for
            individuals who seek to deepen their knowledge, exchange collectibles, and
            share information about the art of collecting. Above all, it fosters good
            and uplifting relationships among collectors. The main goals of the
            Icelandic Numismatic Association are to promote and ignite national interest
            in collecting, remind people of the value and importance of collecting, and
            convey the pleasure and entertainment that collecting can bring, regardless
            of age, class, or status. These principles have stood the test of time
            remarkably well. INA's reach in the world of collectors and collecting in
            Iceland is wide and welcoming.</p>
